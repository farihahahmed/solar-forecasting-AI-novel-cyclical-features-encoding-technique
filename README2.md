# How to use instructions

The files are numbered and should be run in order. 

1 - Data Transformation of Ausgrid Data

2 - Plotting Ausgrid data (data analysis)

3 - Running Hampel Filter through our data

4 - Applying ML models (regular)

5 - Cyclical features encoding


**To skip the data transformation and just run the models, use the CSV files below and start with file 4 and 5 (applying ML models & cyclical features encoding)**

x.csv: Final input data, but run through the hampel filter

y.csv: Final output data, but run through the hampel filter

xwtime.csv: Final input data, but run through the hampel filter. HAS TIME DATA, used this for cyclical features encoding

ywtime.csv: HAS TIME DATA, used this for cyclical features encoding
